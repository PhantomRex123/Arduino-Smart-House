<h1 align="center">Arduino Smart Home!</h1>

<p align="center">*This project is work in progress* This is a neat secure smart house system with arduino, follow along with me. and help make homes safer, and better!</p>


## What does it do?
This project has an API, from either an external application or its own web page, you can controll and manage sensors, relays, etc... This projected Uses the following

### Arduino Due
Main controll system, everythins connect to it

### ESP8266
Webserver, API, Handles everything on the web

### Esp32-Cam
Face detection, and hand motion.

### Motion sensor
Automaticly turn off the lights

### Two channel relay
One of the most important modules

### Microphone, plant moisture
Misc options. These are well coded to provide awesome results
